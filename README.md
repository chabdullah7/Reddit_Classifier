# Reddit Subreddit Classifier

## Project Overview
This project classifies Reddit posts into subreddits using machine learning and deep learning models. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment with Gradio.

## Features
- Data cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and Word2Vec
- Models: Logistic Regression, RNN, LSTM
- Model saving with Pickle and HDF5
- Gradio interface for real-time predictions

## Tools and Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Gensim, NLTK, clean-text, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Gradio

## Results
- Logistic Regression (TF-IDF): ~95% accuracy
- RNN: sequence modeling performance
- LSTM: highest accuracy and robustness
